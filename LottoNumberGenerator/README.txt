Source code for the project is located in 
/src/lottonumbergenerator/

Word document for the algorithm and output files are located in
/Algorithm and Output/

Note: The algorithm pseudocode somewhat differs from the methods used to 
      write the actual code. I realized when writing the actual code 
      that methods used in the word document don't exactly work in java.
